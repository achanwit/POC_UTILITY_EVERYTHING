<p id="pid34">
	The video footage of

	<entity type="DATE">last May</entity>

<br />
<p id="pid35">
	To many,
	<entity type="PERSON">Floyd</entity>
	's death while in police custody became a vivid symbol of police
	brutality - particularly against people of colour - and it sparked
	worldwide demonstrations for racial justice.
</p>
<br />
<p id="pid36">
	But despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the
	<entity type="GPE">US</entity>
	, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on
	duty, if they are charged at all.
</p>
<br />
<p id="pid37">
	The verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how
	the
	<entity type="GPE">US</entity>
	legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody.
